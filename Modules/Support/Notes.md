# WHAT IS LEVEL 1 SUPPORT?
Level 1 support is the first tier of support, usually provided by IT support personnel with the least experience, lower understanding of technical issues, and limited access to company information. The technicians in Level 1:

  * Collect customer requests and data
  * Attend to customer phone calls
  * Respond to user emails and social media messages
  * Conduct basic troubleshooting using questionnaires to find out the level of support needed
  * Create tickets for Level 2 support
  * Provide product information
  * Solve common problems such as username and passwords issues, menu navigation, verification of hardware and software, installation issues, and setup.

When creating a Level 1 support team, pick junior level technical support personnel.  Usually, Level 1 support teams solve user problems by following standard operating procedures (SOP). If no solutions are available as per the training and instructions, Level 1 personnel forward the queries to Level 2 support.

# WHAT IS LEVEL 2 SUPPORT?
Level 2 personnel take queries from Level 1. This level of help mostly deals with in-depth troubleshooting and backend analysis. First, a Level 2 technician reviews the work order from a Level 1 specialist to determine how much support was provided, what the client issue is, and how long the client has worked with the Level 1 agent.

The Level 2 technician then communicates with the user for an in-depth analysis of the problem before providing a solution. If a solution is not available, the query moves up to Level 3 support. Usually, Level 2 support personnel have a deep understanding of the company products and extensive experience in troubleshooting. Level 2 support technicians also have more experience working for the company, in-depth training, and access to all company information.

Tier 2 technicians are not necessarily architects or engineers directly involved in creating the hardware or software in question, but may have experience with programming or using the products. When staffing Level 2 support, look for support technicians.

# WHAT IS LEVEL 3 SUPPORT?
This level of support requires SMEs (Subject Matter Experts). Level 3 support consists of experts, who may include specialists such as architects, engineers, and creators. These support experts have access to the highest level of company and product information. They can provide solutions for a wide variety of technical problems.

When a user query goes up to Level 3 support, the technicians attempt to define the root cause of the problem by looking into code and designs in a lab setting. The technicians may raise the issue with the company to make changes to a product and pass down the solutions to Tier 1 and 2 support.

When creating Level 3 support for your business, look for specialists engaged in creating a product, or people with IT expertise in the creation of a similar product.

# IS THERE A LEVEL 0?
Level 1 to Level 3 of support includes human intervention. Before human intervention, the level of support is called 0. In this tier, users retrieve information from web sources and in-built application help spaces such as manuals, FAQs, and search functions.

The functionality of Tier 0 rests in the hands of developers that create applications and company websites. This level also requires moderators who continually check customer forums for comments. It's also crucial to involve technical marketing in Level 0 to create and update information for users. Without clear instructions and product information, users turn to Tier 1 support.
